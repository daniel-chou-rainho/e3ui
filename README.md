### TODO

* Make "Start/Stop Data Collection" button functional by calling the low-level functions just like in the blog.
* After selecting a file, its name should be displayed below the button for example.
* Green theming to make it look nice and sustainable.
* Not only show power consumption over time, but also indicate total power consumption and then converted to equivalent CO2 emissions.
